/**
 * A Project as defined within the API. This object offers some convenience methods, which will remove some of the busy work about re-querying that
 *  you would have to handle otherwise.
 *
 *  I did not implement the "get_runs" end-point, because I doubt it is useful, it's slow,
 *   it returns a gigantic payloads, and if you really want it, you can stitch it together yourself.
 *   I'm afraid if I implement it, someone will use it and be completely baffled by the results...
 *   It returns ALL test runs underneath ALL test plans within the history of the project. Useless. If
 *   you can present me with a good use-case for implementing it, I'll be all ears (and very surprised)
